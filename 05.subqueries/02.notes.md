# Using Subqueries to Manipulate Data
We can use subqueries in data manipulation language (DML) statements to:
* Retrieve data by using an inline view
* Copy data from one table to another
* Update data in one table based on the values of another table
* Delete rows from one table based on rows in another table

# WITH CHECK OPTION Keyword
The **WITH CHECK OPTION** keyword prohibits you from changing rows that are not in the subquery

# Correlated UPDATE
We use correlated subqueries to update rows in one table based on rows from another table

```sql
UPDATE table1 alias1
SET colum = (
    SELECT expression
    FROM tabale2 alias2
    WHERE alias1.coumn = alias2.column
);
```

# Correlated DELETE
We use the correlated subquery to delete rows in one table based on rows from another table

```sql
DELETE FROM table1 alias1
WHERE colum operator (
    SELECT expression
    FROM tabale2 alias2
    WHERE alias1.coumn = alias2.column
);
```
