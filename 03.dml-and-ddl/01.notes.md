# Managing Tables Using DML Statements

## Data Manipulation Language
A DML statement is executed when we:
* Add new rows to a table
* Modify existing rows in a table
* Remove existing rows from a table

A _transaction_ consists of a collection of DML statements that form a logical unit of work

# Adding a New Row to a Table
Add new rows to a table by using the **INSERT** statement

```sql
INSERT INTO table [(column [, column...])]
VALUES (value [, value...]);
```

> With this syntax only one row is inserted at a time

## Inserting New Rows
* Insert a new row containing values for each column
* List values in a default order of the columns in the table
* Optionally, list the columns in the INSERT clause
* Enclose character and date values within single quotation marks

## Inserting Rows With NULL Values
**Implicit method**: Omit the column from the column list

```sql
INSERT INTO departments (department_id, department_name)
VALUES (30, 'Purchasing');
```

**Explicit method**: Specify the **NULL** keyword in the values list

```sql
INSERT INTO departments
VALUES (100, 'Finance', NULL, NULL);
```

## Inserting Special Values
the **CURRENT_DATE** function records the current date and time in Oracle

```sql
INSERT INTO transactions (transaction_date)
VALUES (CURRENT_DATE);
```

## Inserting Specific Date and Time Values

```sql
INSERT INTO transactions (transaction_date)
VALUES (TO_DATE('FEB 3, 2016', 'MON DD, YYYY'));
```

### Creating a Script
* Use the **&** substitution in a SQL statement to prompt for values
* **&** is a placeholder for the variable value

```sql
INSERT INTO departments
        (department_id, department_name, location_id)
VALUES  (&department_id, &department_name, &location_id);
```

## Copying Rows From Another Table
* Write your **INSERT** statement with a subquery

```sql
INSERT INTO sales_reps (id, name, salary, commission_pct)
SELECT employee_id, last_name, salary, commission_pct
FROM employees
WHERE job_id LIKE '%REP%';
```

* Do not use the **VALUES** clause
* Match the number of columns in the **INSERT** cluase to those in the subquery
* Insert all the rows returned by the subquery in the table **sales_reps**

# UPDATE Statement Syntax
* Modify existing values in a table with the **UPDATE** statement

```sql
UPDATE table
SET column = value [, column = value, ...]
[WHERE condition];
```

* Update more than one row at a time (if required)
* Values for a specific row or rows are modified if you specify the **WHERE** clause
* Values for ALL the rows in the table are modified if you omit the **WHERE** clause
* Specify `SET column_name = NULL` to update a column value to **NULLL**

## Updating Rows Based on Another Table
Use the subqueries in the **UPDATE** statements to update row values in a table based on values from another table

# Removing a Row from a Table
## DELETE Statement
We can remove existing rows from a table by using the **DELETE** statement

```sql
DELETE [FROM] table
[WHERE condition];
```

* Specific rows are deleted if we specify the **WHERE** clause
* All rows in the table are deleted if you omit the **WHERE** clause

## Deleting Rows Based on Another Table
Use the subqueries in the **DELETE** statements to remove rows from a table based on values from another table

# TRUNCATE Statement
* Removes all rows from a table, leaving the table empty and the table structure intact
* Is data definition language (DDL) statement rather than a DML statement
* Can not be undone
* **DELETE** writes to the logs, whereas **TRUNCATE** doesn't, therefore, it's faster but non-recoverable

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE table_namel;
```

## Auto Commit Clauses
* CREATE
* ALTER
* COMMENT
* DROP
* RENAME
* TRUNCATE
* GRANT
* REVOKE

# Database Transaction Control Using COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT
## Database Transactions
A database transaction consists of one of the following:
* DML statements that constitute one consistent change to the data
* One DDL statement
* One data control language (DCL) statement

## Database Transactions: Start and End
* Begin when the first DML SQL statement is executed
* End with one of the following events:
    * A **COMMIT** or **ROLLBACK** statement is used
    * A DDL or DCL statement executes (automatic commit)
    * The user exists SQL Developer or SQL*Plus
    * The system crashes


## Advantages of the COMMIT and ROLLBACK Statements
Using **COMMIT** and **ROLLBACK** statements, we can:
* Ensure data consistency
* Preview data changes before making changes permanent
* Group logically related operation

## Rolling Back Changes to a Marker
* Create a marker in the current transaction by using the **SAVEPOINT** statement
* Roll back to that marker by using the **ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT** statement

```sql
UPDATE ...
SAVEPOINT update_done;

INSERT ...
ROLLBACK TO update_done;
```

## Implicit Transaction Processing
* An automatic commit occurs when:
    * A DDL statemen is issued
    * A DCL statemen is issued
    * There is normal exit from SQL Developer or SQL*Plus, without explicitly issuing **COMMIT** or **ROLLBACK** statements
* An automatic rollback occurs when there is an abnormal termination of SQL Developer or SQL*Plus, or a system failure

## State of Data Before COMMIT or ROLLBACK
* We can recover the data of the previous state
* You can review the results of the DML operations by using the **SELECT** statement in the current session
* Other sessions cannot view the results of the DML statements issued by the current session
* The affected rows are locked; other sessions cannot changes the data in the affected rows

## State of Data After COMMIT
* Data changes are saved in the database
* The previous state of the data is overwritten
* ALl sessions can view the results
* Locks on the affected rows are released; those rows are available for other sessions to manipulate
* All savepoints are erased

### Discard all pending changes by using the ROLLBACK statement
* Data changes are undone
* Previous state of the data is restored
* Locks on the affected rows are released

## Statement Level Rollback
* If a single DML statement fails during execution, only that statement is rolled back
* The Oracle server implements an implicit savepoint
* All other changes are retained
* The user shold terminate transactions explicitly by executing a **COMMIT** or **ROLLBACK** statement

# Read Consistency
* Read consistency guarantess a consistent view of data at all times
* Changes made by one user do not conflict with the changes made by another user
* Read consistency ensures that, on the same data:
    * Readers do not wait for writers
    * Writers do not wait on readers
    * Writers wait for writers

# FOR UPDATE Clause in a SELECT Statement
* Locks the rows in the _EMPLOYEES_ table where _job_id_ is a _SA REP_

```sql
SELECT employee_id, salary, commission_pct, job_id
FROM employees
WHERE job_id = 'SA_REP'
FOR UPDATE
ORDER BY employee_id;
```

* Lock is released only when you issue a **ROLLBACK** or a **COMMIT**
* If the **SELECT** statement attempts to lock a row that is locked by another user, the database waits until the row is available and the returns the results of the **SELECT** statement

## FOR UPDATE Clause: Examples
* You can use the **FOR UPDATE** clause in a **SELECT** statement against multiple tables

```sql
SELECT e.employee_id, e.salary, e.commission_pct
FROM employees e JOIN departments d
USING (department_id)
WHERE job_id = 'ST_CLERK'
AND location_id = 1500
FOR UPDATE
ORDER BY e.employee_id;
```

* Rows from both the **EMPLOYEES** and **DEPARTMENTS** tables are locked
* Use **FOR UPDATE OF column_name** to qualify the column that you intend to change; then only the rows from that specific table are locked

# LOCK TABLE Statement
* Use the **LOCK TABLE** statement to lock one or more tables in a specified mode
* This manually overrides automatic locking
* Tables are locked until you **COMMIT** or **ROLLBACK**

```sql
LOCK TABLE table_name
IN [ROW SHARE / ROW EXCLUSIVE / SHARE UPDATE / SHARE / SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE / EXCLUSIVE] MODE
[NOWAIT];
```
