# Views
* Database object
* Allows us to filter the data that comes from one or more tables
* Allows us to restrict access to data

## Advantages of Views
* Restrict data access
* Make complex queries easy
* Provide data independence
* Present different views of the same data

## Simple Views and Complex Views

| Feature | Simple Views | Complex Views |
|---------|--------------|---------------|
| Number of tables              | One | One or more |
| Contain functions             | No  | Yes |
| Contain groups of data        | No  | Yes |
| DML operations through a view | Yes | Not always |

## Creating a View
* We embed a subquery in the **CREATE VIEW** statement
* The subquery can contain complex **SELECT** syntax

```sql
CREATE [ OR REPLACE ] [ FORCE | NOFORCE ] VIEW view [( alias [, alias]... )]
AS subquery
[ WITH CHECK OPTION [ CONSTRAINT constraint ]]
[ WITH READ ONLY [ CONSTRAINT constraint ]]
```

## Modifying a View
* Use the **CREATE OR REPLACE** clause
* Column aliases in the subquery are listed in the same order as in the **CREATE OR REPLACE** clause

## View Information

```sql
DESCRIBE USER_VIEWS;
```

```sql
SELECT VIEW_NAME FROM USER_VIEWS;
```

```sql
SELECT TEXT FROM USER_VIEWS
WHERE VIEW_NAME = 'EMP_DETAILS_VIEW';
```

## Rules for Performing DML Operations on a View
* We can usually perform DML operations on simple views
* We cannot remove a row if the view contains
    * Group functions
    * A **GROUP BY** clause
    * The **DISTINCT** keyword
    * The pseudocolumn **ROWNUM** keyword

## Rules for Performing Modify Operations on a View
We cannot modify data in a view if it contains:
* Group functions
* A **GROUP BY** clause
* The **DISTINCT** keyword
* The pseudocolumn **ROWNUM** keyword
* Expressions

## Rules for Performing Insert Operations on a View
We cannot add data in a view if the view includes:
* Group functions
* A **GROUP BY** clause
* The **DISTINCT** keyword
* The pseudocolumn **ROWNUM** keyword
* Columns defined by expressions
* **NOT NULL** columns without default value in the base tables that are not selected by the view

## Using the WITH CHECK OPTION Clause
We can prevent changes from happening using the **WITH CHECK OPTION**

## Denying DML Operations
* We can ensure that no DML operations occur on our view by adding the **WITH READ ONLY** option to our view definition
* Any DML attempt will result in an Oracle Server error

## Removing a View
We can remove view without losing data because a view is based on underlying tables in the database

```sql
DROP VIEW view;
```
