# Database Objecst

| Object | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Table     | Basic unit of storage; composed of rows |
| View      | Logically represents subsets of data from one or more tables |
| Sequence  | Generates numeric values |
| Index     | Improves the performance of data retrieval queries |
| Synonym   | Gives alternative names to objects |

## Referencing Another User's Table
* Tables belonging to other users are not in the user's schema
* We should use the owner's name as a prefix of those tables

# Sequences
A Sequence:
* Can automatically generate unique numbers
* Is a shareable object
* Can be used to create a primary key value
* Replaces application code
* Speed up the efficiency of accessing sequence values when cached in memory

## Default Sequence Values
* **MIN_VALUE**: 1
* **MAX_VALUE**: 99999999999...
* **INCREMENT_BY**: 1
* **CACHE_SIZE**: 20
* **LAST_NUMBER**: 21

## CREATE SEQUENCE Statement: Syntax
Define a sequence to generate sequential numbers automatically

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE [ schema. ] sequence
    [   { START WITH | INCREMENT BY } ] integer
        | { MAXVALUE integer | NOMAXVALUE }
        | { MINVALUE integer | NOMINVALUE }
        | { CYCLE | NOCYCLE}
        | { CACHE integer | NOCACHE}
        | { ORDER | NOORDER}
        | { SCALE | NOSCALE}
        | { SHARD | NOSHARD}
    ];
```

## NEXTVAL and CURRVAL Pseudocolumns
* **NEXTVAL** returns the next available sequence value. It returns a unique value every time it is referenced, even for different users
* **CURRVAL** obtains the current sequence value
* **NEXTVAL** must be issued for that sequence before **CURRVAL** can be referenced

## SQL Column Defaulting Using a Sequence
* We can use the SQL Syntax **<sequence>.NEXTVAL**, **<sequence>.CURRVAL** as a SQL column defaulting expression for numeric columns, where **<sequence>** is an Oracle database sequence
* The **DEFAULT** expression can include the sequence presudocolumns **CURRVAL** and **NEXTVAL**, as long as the sequence exists and you have the privileges necessary to access it

## Caching Sequence Values
* Caching sequences values in memory gives faster access to those values
* Gaps in sequence values can occur when
    * A rollback occurs
    * The system crashes
    * A sequence is used in another table

## Modifying a Sequence
* Modify the sequence using the **ALTER** clause
* Change the increment value, maximum value, minimum value, cycle option, or cache option

### Guidelines for Modifying a Sequence
* You must be the owner or have the **ALTER** privilege for the sequence
* Only future sequence numbers are affected
* The sequence must be dropped and re-created to restart the sequence at a different number
* Some validation is performed
* To remove a sequence use the statement

```sql
DROP SEQUENCE <sequence_name>;
```

## Sequence Information
The **USER_SEQUENCES** view describes all the sequences we own

```sql
DESCRIBE user_sequences;
```

Verify our sequence values in the **USER_SEQUENCES** data dictionary table

```sql
SELECT * FROM USER_SEQUENCES;
```

# Synonyms
* Is a database object
* Can be created to give an alternative name to a table or to another database object
* Requires no storage other than its definition in the data dictionary
* Is useful for hiding the identity and location of an underlying schema object

## Creating and Dropping a Synonym for an Object
* We can simplify access to objects by creating a synonym (another name for an object)
* With synonyms, you can:
    * Create an easier reference to a table that is owned by another user
    * Shorten lenghty object names

```sql
CREATE [PUBLIC] SYNONYM synonym FOR object;
DROP SYNONYM synonym;
```

## Synonym Information

```sql
DESCRIBE USER_SYNONYMS;
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM USER_SYNONYMS;
```

# Indexes
* Is a schema object
* Can be used by the Oracle Server to speed up the retrieval of rows using a pointer
* Can reduce disk input/output (I/O) by using a rapid path access method to locate data quickly
* Is dependent on the table that it indexes
* Is used and maintained automatically by the Oracle Server

## How are Indexes Created?
### Automatically
A unique index is created when you define a **PRIMARY KEY** or **UNIQUE** constraint in the table definition

### Manually
We can create a unique or nonunique index on columns to speed up access to the rows

## Creating an Index
* Create an index on one or more columns

```sql
CREATE [UNIQUE] INDEX index
ON table (column [, column]...);
```

## CREATE INDEX with CREATE TABLE

```sql
...
employee_id NUMBER(6)
    PRIMARY KEY USING INDEX (
        CREATE INDEX emp_id_idx
        ON NEW_EMP(employee_id)
    ),
...
```

## Function-Based Indexes
* A function-based index is based on expressions
* The index expression is built from table columns, constants, SQL functions, and user-defined functions

```sql
CREATE INDEX upper_dept_name_idx
ON dept2(UPPER(department_name));
```

```sql
SELECT *
FROM dept2
WHERE UPPER(department_name) = 'SALES';
```

## Multiple Indexes on the Same Set of Columns
We can create multiple indexes on the same set of columns if the indexes:
* Are of different types
* Use different partitioning
* Have different uniqueness properties

## Index Information
* **USER_INDEXES** provides information about our indexes
* **USER_IND_COLUMNS** describes columns of indexes owned by us and columns of indexes on our tables

## Removing an Index
* Remove an index from the data dictionary by using the **DROP INDEX** command

```sql
DROP INDEX index;
```

* To drop an index, you must be the owner of the index or have the **DROP ANY INDEX** privilege
