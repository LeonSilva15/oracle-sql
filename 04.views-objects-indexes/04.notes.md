# Managing Constaints

## Adding a Constraint Syntax
Use the **ALTER TABLE** statement to:
* Add or drop a constraint, but not to modify its structure
* Enable or disable constraints
* Add a **NOT NULL** constraint by using the **MODIFY** clause

```sql
ALTER TABLE <table_name>
ADD [CONSTRAINT <constraint_name>]
type (<column_name>);
```

## Dropping a Constraint
The **DROP CONSTRAINT** clause enables us to drop an integrity constraint from a database

## Dropping a Constraint ONLINE
Indicate that DML operations on the table are allowed while dropping the constraint

## ON DELETE Clause
* Use the **ON DELETE CASCADE** clause to delete child rows when a parent key is deleted
* Use the **ON DELTE SET NULL** clause to set the child rows value to null when a parent key is deleted

## Cascading Constraints
The **CASCADE CONSTRAINTS** clause:
* Is used along with the **DROP COLUMN** clause
* Drops all referential integrity constraints that refer to the **PRIMARY** and **UNIQUE** keys defined on the dropped columns
* Drops all multicolumn constraints defined on the dropped columns

## Renaming Table Columns and Constraints
Rename table

```sql
ALTER TABLE markting RENAME to new_marketing;
```

Rename Column

```sql
ALTER TABLE new_marketing RENAME COLUMN team_id TO id;
```

Rename Constraint

```sql
ALTER TABLE new_marketing RENAME CONSTRAINT mktg_pk TO new_mktg_pk;
```

## Disabling Constraints
* Deactivate a constraint using the **DISABLE** clause
* Disable all dependent constraints using the **CASCADE** option

## Enabling Constraints
* Activate a disabled constraint using the **ENABLE** clause
* A **UNIQUE** index is automatically created if we enable a **UNIQUE** key or a **PRIMARY KEY** constraint

## Constraint States
A Constraint can be in one of the following states:
* ENABLE VALIDATE
* ENABLE NOVALIDATE
* DISABLE VALIDATE
* DISABLE NOVALIDATE

## Deferring Constraints
Constraints can have the following attributes
* **DEFERRABLE** or **NOT DEFERRABLE**
* **INITIALLY DEFERRED** or **INITIALLY IMMEDIATE**
* If deffered, it checks the constraints on **COMMIT**

## Difference between INITIALLY DEFERRED and INITIALLY IMMEDIATE
* INITIALLY DEFERRED: Waits until the transaction ends to check the constraint
* INITIALLY IMMEDIATE: Checks the constraints at the end of the statement execution

## DROP TABLE ... PURGE
The dropped tables go to the recycle bin, if we want to delete it permanently and release the space in memory, add the **PURGE** option to the **DROP TABLE** clause

# Temporary Table
* Holds data that exists only for the duration of a transaction os session
    * data is private to the session
* Can be either a Global Temporary Table or a Private Temporary Table

## Characteristics
| Characteristic | Global | Private |
|----------------|--------|---------|
| Naming rules | Same as permanent tables | Must be prefixed with ORA$PTT_ |
| Visibility of table definition | All sessions | Only the session that created the table |
| Storage of table definition | Disk | Memory only |
| Types | Transaction specific (**ON COMMIT DELTE ROWS**) or session specific (**ON COMMIT PRESERVE ROWS**) | Transaction specific (**ON COMMIT DROP DEFINITION**) or session specific (**ON COMMIT PRESERVE DEFINITION**) |

## Creating a Directory for the External Table
Create a **DIRECTORY** object that corresponds to the directory on the file system where the external data source resides

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE DIRECTORY emp_dir
AS '/.../emp_dir';

GRANT READ ON DIRECTORY emp_dir TO ora_21;
```

## Creating an External Table
Syntax:

```sql
CREATE TABLE <table_name>
    (<col_name> <data_type>, ...)
ORGANIZATION EXTERNAL (
    TYPE <access_driver_type>
    DEFAULT DIRECTORY <directory_name>
    ACCESS PARAMETERS (...) 
) LOCATION ('<location_specifier>')
REJECT LIMIT [ 0 | <number> | UNLIMITED ];
```
