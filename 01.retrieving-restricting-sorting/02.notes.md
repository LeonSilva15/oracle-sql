## Limiting Rows by Using a Selection
- We can limit the retrieved rows using conditions in the **SELECT** statement
- Restricting the rows that are returned by using a **WHERE** clause
- The **WHERE** clause follows the **FROM** clause

```sql
SELECT * | {[ DISTINCT ] column [ alias ], ...}
FROM table
[ WHERE logical expression(s) ];
```

## Character Strings and Dates
- Character strings and date values are enclosed within single quotation marks **''**
- Character values are case-sensitive and date values are format-sensitive
- The default display format for date is DD-MON-RR

## Comparison Operators
| Operator | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| =        | Equal to |
| >        | Greater than |
| >=       | Greater than or equal to |
| <        | Less than |
| <=       | Less than or equal to |
| <>       | Not equal to |
| BETWEEN ...AND... | Between two values (inclusive) |
| IN(set)  | Match any of a list of values |
| LIKE     | Match a character pattern |
| IS NULL  | Is a null value |

## Pattern Matching Using the LIKE Operator
- We can use the LIKE operator to perform wildcard searches of valid string patterns
- The search conditions can contain either literal characters or numbers:
    - **%** denotes zero or more characters
    - **_** denotes one caracter
- We can combine the two wildcard symbols (**%**, **_**) with literal characters for pattern matching
- We can use the **ESCAPE** identifier to search for the actual **%** and **_** symbols
