## Limiting Rows by Using a Selection
- We can limit the retrieved rows using conditions in the **SELECT** statement
- Restricting the rows that are returned by using a **WHERE** clause
- The **WHERE** clause follows the **FROM** clause

```sql
SELECT * | {[ DISTINCT ] column [ alias ], ...}
FROM table
[ WHERE logical expression(s) ];
```

## Character Strings and Dates
- Character strings and date values are enclosed within single quotation marks **''**
- Character values are case-sensitive and date values are format-sensitive
- The default display format for date is DD-MON-RR

## Comparison Operators
| Operator | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| =        | Equal to |
| >        | Greater than |
| >=       | Greater than or equal to |
| <        | Less than |
| <=       | Less than or equal to |
| <>       | Not equal to |
| BETWEEN ...AND... | Between two values (inclusive) |
| IN(set)  | Match any of a list of values |
| LIKE     | Match a character pattern |
| IS NULL  | Is a null value |

## Pattern Matching Using the LIKE Operator
- We can use the LIKE operator to perform wildcard searches of valid string patterns
- The search conditions can contain either literal characters or numbers:
    - **%** denotes zero or more characters
    - **_** denotes one caracter
- We can combine the two wildcard symbols (**%**, **_**) with literal characters for pattern matching
- We can use the **ESCAPE** identifier to search for the actual **%** and **_** symbols

## Using NULL Conditions
- We can use the **IS NULL** operator to test for **NULL** values in a column

## Defining Conditions Using Logical Operators
| Operator | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| AND      | Returns TRUE if both component conditions are true |
| OR       | Returns TRUE if either component condition is true |
| NOT      | Returns TRUE if the condition is false |

## Rules of Precedence
| Order | Operator |
|-------|----------|
| 1     | Arithmetic operators |
| 2     | Concatenation operator |
| 3     | Comparison conditions |
| 4     | **IS** [**NOT**] **NULL**, **LIKE**, [**NOT**] **IN** |
| 5     | [**NOT**] **BETWEEN** |
| 6     | Not equal to |
| 7     | **NOT** logical operator |
| 8     | **AND** logical operator |
| 9     | **OR** logical operator |

## Using the ORDER BY Clause
- We can sort the retrieved rows with the **ORDER BY** clause
    - **ASC**: Ascending order, default
    - **DESC**: Descending order
