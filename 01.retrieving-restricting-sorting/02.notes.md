## Limiting Rows by Using a Selection
- We can limit the retrieved rows using conditions in the **SELECT** statement
- Restricting the rows that are returned by using a **WHERE** clause
- The **WHERE** clause follows the **FROM** clause

```sql
SELECT * | {[ DISTINCT ] column [ alias ], ...}
FROM table
[ WHERE logical expression(s) ];
```

## Character Strings and Dates
- Character strings and date values are enclosed within single quotation marks **''**
- Character values are case-sensitive and date values are format-sensitive
- The default display format for date is DD-MON-RR
