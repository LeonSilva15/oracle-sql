## Writing SQL Statements
- SQL statements are not case-sensitive
- SQL statements can be entered on one or more lines
- Keywords cannot be abbreviated or split across lines
- Clauses are usually placed on separate lines
- Indents are used to enhance readability

## Basic SELECT Statement
- SELECT identifies the columns to be displayed
- FROM identifies the able containing those columns

```sql
SELECT * | { [DISTINCT] column [alias], ... }
FROM table;
```

## dual in Oracle
- **dual** is a table automatically created by Oracle Database
- **dual** has one column called _DUMMY_, of data type _VARCHAR(1)_, and contains one wor with a value _x_.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM dual;
```
|   | DUMMY |
|---|-------|
| 1 |   X   |

## Arithmetic Expressions
| Operator | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| +        | Add         |
| -        | Subtract    |
| *        | Multiply    |
| /        | Divide      |

## Defining a Null Value
- **Null** is a value that is unavailable, unassigned, unknown, or inapplicable
- **Null** is not the same as zero or a blank space
- **Null** arithmetic operations will always return null

## Defining a Column Alias
- Renames a column heading
- Is useful with calculations
- Immediately follows the column name (optional **AS** keyword)
- Requires double quotation marks if it contains spaces or spacial characters, or if it is case sensitive

## Concatenation Operator
- Links columns or character strings to other columns
- Is represented by two vertical bars (**||**)
- Creates a resultant column that is a character expression
- Concatenating chars text and numbers will result in text

## CONCAT Function
- Will only take two parameters
- We can nest them to concat more than one string

## Literal Character Strings
- A character, number, or date that is included in the **SELECT** statement
- Date and character literal values must be enclosed within single quotation marks
- Each character string is output once for each row returned

## Alternative Quote (q) Operator
- Specify your own quotation mark delimiter
- Select any delimeter
- Increase readability and usability
- You prefix your literal with the letter **q**, then you type a single quote, followeed by your starting delimiter for the literal: **q'[]'**

## Duplicate Rows
- The default display of queries is all rows, including duplicate rows
- We can get rid of duplicate rows using the DISTINCT keyword

## Describing a table
- Displaying table structure is done using the **DESCRIBE** command
