# Subquery
We can subquery when we require to extract information from a result
* Also known as the inner-query
* The subquery executes before the main query
* The result of the subquery is used by the main query

```sql
SELECT select_list
FROM table
WHERE expr operator (
    SELECT select_list
    FROM table
);
```

## Rules and Guidelines
* Enclose subqueries in parentheses
* Subqueries can appear on either side of the comparison, but usually in the right side for readability
* Single row operators for single row subqueries and multiple rows (rows of results) operators for multiple row subqueries

## Single Row Subqueries
* Return only one row
* Use single row comparison operators

| Operator | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| =     | Equal to |
| >     | Greater than |
| >=    | Greater than or Equal to|
| <     | Less than |
| <=    | Less than or Equal to|
| <>    | Not equal to |

## HAVING Clause with Subqueries
The database server:
* Executes the subqueries first
* Returns the result into the **HAVING** clause of the main query

## Multiple Row Subqueries
* Return more than one row
* Use multiple row comparison operators

| Operator | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| IN    | Equal to any member in the list |
| ANY   | Must be preceded by `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `=>`, `<=`. This returns `TRUE` if at least one element exists in the restult set of the subquery for which the relation is `TRUE` |
| ALL   | Must be preceded by `=`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `=>`, `<=`. This returns `TRUE` if the relation is `TRUE` for all the elements in the result set of the subquery |

## Multiple Column Subqueries
* A multiple column subquery returns more than one column to the outer query
* Column comparisons in multiple column comparisons can be pairwise or nonpairwise
* A multiple-column suquery can also be used in the `FROM` clause of a `SELECT` statement

Syntax:
```sql
SELECT column, column, ...
FROM table
WHERE (column1, column2, ...) IN (
    SELECT column1, column2, ...
    FROM table
    WHERE condition
);
```

## Handling the NULL in a subquery list
If we combine the `NOT IN` operator with a list containing a `NULL` value, it will be empty, we need to remove the `NULL` before using the `NOT IN` (in the subquery)
