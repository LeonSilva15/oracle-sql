# Set Operators
* **UNION** / **UNION ALL**
* **INTERSECT**
* **MINUS**

## Rules
* The expressions in the `SELECT` list must match in number
* The data type of each column in the subsequent query must match the data type of its corresponding column in the first query
* Parentheses can be used to alter the sequence of execution
* The `ORDER BY` clause can appear only at the very end of the statement
* Duplicate rows are automatically eliminated except in `UNION ALL`
* Column names from the first query appear in the result
* The output is sorted in ascending order by default, except in `UNION ALL`

## UNION Operator
Returns rows from both queries after eliminating duplications

## UNION ALL Operator
Returns rows from both queries, including duplications

## INTERSECT Operator
Returns rows that are common to both queries 

## MINUS Operator
Returns all the distintc rows selected by the first query, but not present in the second query result set

## Matching SELECT statements
We must match the data type (using the `TO_CHAR` function or any other conversion functions) when columns don't exist in one or the other column

```sql
SELECT location_id, department_name "Department", TO_CHAR(NULL) "Warehouse location"
FROM departments
UNION
SELECT location_id, TO_CHAR(NULL) "Department", state_province
FROM locations;
```

## Using the ORDER BY in Set Operators
* The `ORDER BY` can only appear once at the end of the compound query
* Component queries cannot have individual `ORDER BY` clauses
* The `ORDER BY` clause recognizes only the columns of the first `SELECT` query
* By default, the first column of the first `SELECT` query is used to sort the output in ascending order
