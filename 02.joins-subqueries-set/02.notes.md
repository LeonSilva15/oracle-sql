## Obtaining Data From Multiple Tables
in some cases we need to retrieve data from multiple tables, here we can use **JOINS** to solve this problem

## Types of Joins
Joins that compliant with the _ANSI_ standard:
- Natural join with the **NATURAL JOIN** clause
- Join with the **USING** clause
- Join with the **ON** clause
- **OUTER** joins
    - **LEFT OUTER JOIN**
    - **RIGHT OUTER JOIN**
    - **FULL OUTER JOIN**
- Cross joins

### NATURAL JOIN
It uses all the columns sharing name and data type automatically

### OUTER JOIN
The **OUTER** keyword is optional

### CROSS JOIN
Also known as Cartesian. Displays all the possible rows combinations

## Joining Tables Using SQL Syntax
Use a **JOIN** to query data from more than one table

```sql
SELECT table1.column, table2.column
FROM table1
[ NATURAL JOIN table2 ] |
[ JOIN table2 USING( column_name ) ] |
[ JOIN table2 ON( table1.column_name = table2.column_name) ] |
[ LEFT | RIGHT | FULL OUTER JOIN table2
    ON( table1.colum_name = table2.column_name ) ] |
[ CROSS JOIN table2 ];
```

### Creating Natural Joins
- The **NATURAL JOIN** clause is based on all the columns that have the same name in two tables
- It selects rows from the two tables that have equal values in all matched columns
- If the columns having the same names have different data types, an error is returned

```sql
SELECT * FROM table1 NATURAL JOIN table2;
```

### Creating Joins with the USING Clause
When shoul we use the **USING** clause?
- If several columns have the same names but the data types do not match, use the **USING** clause to specify the columns for the equijoin
- Use the **USING** clause to match only one column when more than one column matches

### Qualifying Ambiguous Column Names
- Use table prefixes to:
    - Qualify column names that are in multiple tables
    - Increase the speed of parsing of a statement
- Instead of full table prefixes, use table aliases
- Table alias gives a table a shorter name
- Use column aliases to distinguish columns that have identical names but reside in different tables

### Using Table Aliases with the USING Clause in Oracle
- Do not qualify a column that is used in the **NATURAL JOIN** or a **JOIN** with a **USING** clause
- If the same column is used elsewhere in the SQL statement, do not alias it

### Creating Joins with the ON Clause
- The join condition for the **NATURAL JOIN** is basically an equijoin of all columns with the same name
- Use the **ON** clause to specify arbitrary conditions or specify the columns to join
- Use the **ON** clause to separate the join condition from other search conditions
- The **ON** clause makes code easy to undestand

## Appliying Additional Conditions to a Join
Use the AND clause or the **WHERE** clause to apply additional conditions

## Self-Joins Using the ON Clause
We can self-join tables using the **ON** clause to differentiate data in the same table

## INNER Versus OUTER Joins
- The join of two tables returning only matched rows is called an **INNER JOIN**
- A join between two tables that returns the results of the **INNER JOIN** as well as the unmatched rows from the left (or right) table is called a **LEFT** (or **RIGH**) **OUTER JOIN**
- A **JOIN** between two tables that returns the results of an **INNER JOIN** as well as the results of a **LEFT** and **RIGHT JOIN** is a **FULL OUTER JOIN**

## Cartesian Products
A Cartesian product:
- Is a join of every row of one table to every row of another table
- Generates a large number of rows and the result is rarely useful

### Creating Cross Joins
- A **CROSS JOIN** is a **JOIN** operation that produces a Cartesian product of two tables
- To create a Cartesian product, specify **CROSS JOIN** in your **SELECT** statement
