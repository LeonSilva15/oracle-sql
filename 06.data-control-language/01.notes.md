# Controlling User Access
## Privileges
There are two types of privileges:
* System priviliges: Performing a particular action within the database
* Object priviliges: Manipulating the content of the database object

## System Privileges
* There are more than 200 priveleges
* The DBA has high-level system privileges for tasks such as:
    * Creating new users
    * Removing users
    * Removing tables
    * Backing up tables

## Controlling User Access
### Creating Users
The DBA creates users with the **CREATE USERS** statement

```sql
CREATE USER user
IDENTIFIED BY password;
```

## User System Privileges
* After a user is created, the DBA can grant specific system privileges to that user

```sql
GRANT privilege [, privilege...]
TO user [, user | role, PUBLIC ...];
```

* An application developer, for example, may have the following system privileges:
    * **CREATE SESSION**
    * **CREATE TABLE**
    * **CREATE SEQUENCE**
    * **CREATE VIEW**
    * **CREATE PROCEDURE**

* We can create a role to assign a set privileges, and then assign the role instead of privilege by privilege

# Changing Password
* The DBA creates our user account and initializes the password
* We can change our password by using the **ALTER USER** statement

# Object Privileges
* Object privileges vary from object to object
* An owner:
    * has all the privileges on the object
    * can give specific privileges on the objects they own
* Syntax:

```sql
GRANT   object_priv [(columns)] | ALL
ON      object
TO      {user | role | PUBLIC}
[ WITH GRANT OPTION ];
```

| Object Privilege | Table | View | Sequence |
|------------------|-------|------|----------|
| ALTER         | :heavy_check_mark: |  | :heavy_check_mark: |
| DELETE        | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |  |
| INDEX         | :heavy_check_mark: |  |  |
| INSERT        | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |  |
| REFERENCES    | :heavy_check_mark: |  |  |
| SELECT        | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| UPDATE        | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |  |

## Confirming Granted Privileges
| Data Dictionary View | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| ROLE_SYS_PRIVS | System privileges granted to roles |
| ROLE_TAB_PRIVS | Table privileges granted to roles |
| USER_ROLE_PRIVS | Roles accessible by the user |
| USER_SYS_PRIVS | System priveleges granted to the user |
| USER_TAB_PRIVS_MADE | Object privileges granted to user's objects |
| USER_TAB_PRIVS_RECD | Object privileges granted to the user |
| USRE_COL_PRIVS_MADE | Object privileges granted on the columns of the user's objects |
| USER_COL_PRIVS_RECD | Object privileges granted to the user on specific columns |

## Revoking Object Privileges

ON object
FROM { user [, user... ] | role | PUBLIC }
[ CASCADE CONSTRAINTS ];
```
