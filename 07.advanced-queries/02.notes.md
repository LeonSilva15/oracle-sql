# TIME_ZONE Session Parameter
**TIME_ZONE** may be set to:
* An absolute offset
* Database time zone
* OS local time zone
* A named region

```sql
ALTER SESSION SET TIME_ZONE = '-05:00';
ALTER SESSION SET TIME_ZONE = dbtimezone;
ALTER SESSION SET TIME_ZONE = local;
ALTER SESSION SET TIME_ZONE = 'America/New_York';
```
# CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, and LOCALTIMESTAMP
* **CURRENT_DATE**
    * Returns the current date from the user session
    * Has a data type of **DATE**
* **CURRENT_TIMESTAMP**:
    * Returns the current date and time from the user session
    * Has a data type of **TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE**
* **LOCALTIMESTAMP**:
    * Returns the current date and time from the user session
    * Has a data type of **TIMESTAMP**

# TIMESTAMP Data Types
| Data Type | Fields |
|-----------|--------|
| TIMESTAMP | Year, Month, Day, Hour, Minute, Second with fractional seconds |
| TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE | Same as TIMESTAMP data type; also includes: TIMEZONE_HOUR, and TIMEZONE_MINUTE or TIMEZONE_REGION |
| TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE | Same as the TIMESTAMP data type; also includes a time zone offset in its value |

# INTERVAL Data Types
* We can use **INTERVAL** data types to store the difference between two datetimes values
* There are two classes of intervals:
    * Year-month
    * Day-time
* The precision of the interval is:
    * The actual subset of fields that constitutes an interval
    * Specified in the interval qualifier

| Data Type | Fields |
|-----------|--------|
| INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH | Year, Month |
| INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND | Days, Hour, Minute, Second with fractional seconds |

## INTERVAL Fields

| INTERVAL Field | Valid Values for Interval |
|----------------|---------------------------|
| YEAR      | Any positive or negative integer |
| MONTH     | 00 to 11 |
| DAY       | Any positive or negative integer |
| HOUR      | 00 to 23 |
| MINUTE    | 00 to 59 |
| SECOND    | 00 to 59.9(N) where 9(N) is precision |

# Date and Time functions
* EXTRACT
* TZ_OFFSET
* FROM_TZ
* TO_TIMESTAMP
* TO_YMINTERVAL
* TO_DSINTERVAL

# Daylight Saving Time (DST)
* Start of Dayligh Saving:
    * Time jumps from 01:59:59 AM to 03:00:00 AM
    * Values from 02:00:00 AM to 02:59:59 AM are not valid
* End of Dalight Saving
    * Time jumps back from 02:00:00 AM to 01:00:01 AM
    * Values from 01:00:01 AM to 02:00:00 AM are ambiguous because they are visited twice
